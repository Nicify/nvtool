Video encoding tool based on rigaya's NVEncC.

Check out the link below to see if your graphics card supports NVENC.

https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new

Options Reference:

Preset

Encode quality preset.

- P1 (= performance)
- P2
- P3
- P4 (= default)
- P5
- P6
- P7 (= quality)


Quality

Set target quality when using VBR mode. (0.0-51.0, 0 = automatic)


Bitrate

Set bitrate in kbps.

To enable constant quality mode, set the value to 0.


AQ

- temporal - Enable adaptive quantization between frames.

- spatial - Enable adaptive quantization in frame.


Strength

Specify the AQ strength. 1 = weak, 15 = strong, 0 = auto


HEVC

Specify the output codec as HEVC, default is h264.


Resize

Set output resolution. When it is different from the input resolution, HW/GPU resizer (Lanczos 4x4) will be activated automatically.

If not specified, it will be same as the input resolution. (no resize)

*Special Values*

- 0 ... Will be same as input.
- One of width or height as negative value
  Will be resized keeping aspect ratio, and a value which could be divided by the negative value will be chosen.

Example: 
input  1280x720
Resize 1024x576 -> normal
Resize 960x0    -> resize to 960x720 (0 will be replaced to 720, same as input)
Resize 1920x-2  -> resize to 1920x1080 (calculated to keep aspect ratio)


Filter Reference:

KNN

Strong noise reduction filter.

Parameters:
- radius=<int> (default=3, 1-5)
  radius of filter.
- strength=<float> (default=0.08, 0.0 - 1.0)
  Strength of the filter.
- lerp=<float> (default=0.2, 0.0 - 1.0)
  The degree of blending of the original pixel to the noise reduction pixel.
- th_lerp=<float> (default=0.8, 0.0 - 1.0)
  Threshold of edge detection.

PMD

Rather weak noise reduction by modified pmd method, aimed to preserve edge while noise reduction.

Parameters:
- apply_count=<int> (default=2, 1- )
  Number of times to apply the filter.
- strength=<float> (default=100, 0-100)
  Strength of the filter.
- threshold=<float> (default=100, 0-255)
  Threshold for edge detection. The smaller the value is, more will be detected as edge, which will be preserved.

Unsharp

unsharp filter, for edge and detail enhancement.

Parameters:
- radius=<int> (default=3, 1-9)
  radius of edge / detail detection.
- weight=<float> (default=0.5, 0-10)
  Strength of edge and detail emphasis. Larger value will result stronger effect.
- threshold=<float> (default=10.0, 0-255)
  Threshold for edge and detail detection.

EdgeLevel 

Edge level adjustment filter, for edge sharpening.

Parameters:
- strength=<float> (default=5.0, -31 - 31)
  Strength of edge sharpening. Larger value will result stronger edge sharpening.
- threshold=<float> (default=20.0, 0 - 255)
  Noise threshold to avoid enhancing noise. Larger value will treat larger luminance change as noise.
- black=<float> (default=0.0, 0-31)
  strength to enhance dark part of edges.
- white=<float> (default=0.0, 0-31)
  strength to enhance bright part of edges.

SIL Open Font License v1.1
====================================================


Preamble
----------

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
